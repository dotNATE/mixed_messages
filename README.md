# Cluedo Message Generator

A small practice program built using Javascript, Node.js, and Git  
I'm following a loose tutorial that can be found in CodeAcademy's Full Stack Engineer path

This is the first time I've built anything in my own environment; I'm hoping this will help me become more confident in designing and building my own ideas, tightening up my Javascript, and learning to use Git for version control.

This program will return a random possible outcome of playing Cluedo. i.e. "It was x in the y with z!"
