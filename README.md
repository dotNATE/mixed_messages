# Cluedo Message Generator

A small practice program built using Javascript, Node.js, and Git as part of CodeAcademy's Full Stack Engineer path.

This is the first time I've built anything in my own environment; I'm hoping this will help me become more confident in designing and building my own projects and learning to use Git for version control.

This program will return a random possible outcome of playing Cluedo. i.e. "It was x in the y with z!"

## Technologies

Javascript ES6, Git v2.29.1, Node.js v14.15.0, Visual Studio Code

## Launch

To run this program use the terminal to navigate to the directory where you have it saved and run `$ node script.js`

There you go! Who did you get?
